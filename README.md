# Rated Stats – NoChat

**PvP Chat Input Lock (Retail)**

Rated Stats – NoChat lets you **see all chat messages**, but **blocks your chat input while you’re in PvP**, so you can’t type something in rage and risk a ban. When you leave PvP, chat input is **unblocked automatically**.

---

## What it does

- ✅ Keeps chat **visible** (does **not** hide messages)
- ✅ Blocks your **chat input** when you enter PvP
- ✅ Restores chat input when you leave PvP

---

## Settings

Retail Settings UI:
`Esc → Options → AddOns → Rated Stats - NoChat`

### Whisper exceptions
- **Allow all whispers**
  - Allows both character and Battle.net whispers while other chat is blocked in PvP.
- **Allow Battle.net whispers only**
  - Allows only Battle.net whispers; in-game character whispers remain blocked.
- **Always allow Party chat**
  - Never block Party chat, even when other chat is restricted/blocked in PvP instances.

### Per-mode blocking (all ON by default)
- Block chat in Arena Skirmishes
- Block chat in Normal Battlegrounds
- Block chat in Epic Battlegrounds
- Block chat in Solo Shuffle
- Block chat in 2v2
- Block chat in 3v3
- Block chat in Battleground Blitz
- Block chat in Rated Battlegrounds
- Block chat in other PvP Modes

- When you enter/leave a blocked PvP mode, it prints “Chat input disabled/restored”.
- If you keep pressing Enter in PvP, it prints a “blocked” reminder but rate-limited (every 2 seconds).

## Install

**Recommended:** Install from CurseForge:  
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rated-stats-nochat

---

## Usage

No setup required.

- Enter a PvP instance → chat input is blocked.
- Leave PvP → chat input is restored.

---

## Why

This is a “guardrail” addon:
- You still get full team comms (you can read everything),
- but you can’t impulsively type/say/yell something that gets you reported.
